# 🚗 CV Lane Detection: Drive Safe with AI Eyes! 👀

Welcome to CV_Lane_Detection – the ultimate Computer Vision powerhouse that keeps you in your lane... literally! 🚦 This full-stack web app uses cutting-edge AI to spot illegal lane changes while you're cruising, and throws up a big, bold WARNING if danger's afoot. No more risky swerves – just smart, safe driving! 🌟
📝 About the Project
Tired of lane-hopping hazards on the road? This project is your guardian angel! Built with love for computer vision enthusiasts, it detects lane markings in real-time, analyzes vehicle movement, and alerts you to potential violations. Perfect for self-driving tech, driver assistance systems, or just hacking on fun CV experiments.

Tech Stack: Computer Vision magic with OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (or your fave ML lib), and a sleek web frontend for live demos. 🛠️
Goal: Promote safer roads by preventing accidents caused by improper lane changes. Safety first! 🛡️

✨ Features

Real-Time Lane Detection 🎥: Scans video feeds to identify lanes using edge detection and Hough transforms.
Illegal Change Alerts ⚠️: Smart algorithms flag when you're drifting dangerously – with audio/visual warnings!
Web App Interface 🌐: Upload videos, stream from cams, and see detections live in your browser.
Customizable Thresholds 🔧: Tweak sensitivity for different road conditions (highways, city streets, rainy days ☔).
Data Logging 📊: Records incidents for review – great for fleet management or learning.

🛠️ Installation
Get rolling in minutes! (Assuming a Python environment – we'll add setup scripts soon.)

Clone the repo:  
git clone https://github.com/RAGxPhoenix/CV_Lane_Detection.git
cd CV_Lane_Detection


Install dependencies:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Coming soon! For now: opencv-python, numpy, flask


Fire it up:  
python app.py

Head to http://localhost:5000 and start detecting! 🚀


📺 Usage

Demo Mode: Upload a driving video and watch the lanes light up with overlays. Warnings pop if shenanigans detected!
Live Stream: Connect your webcam or dashcam for real-time action.
Example:

Pro Tip: Train on your own datasets for hyper-accurate results! 📈
